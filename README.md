# Open-VOT

Open-VOT is a lightweight library of visual object tracking for research purpose. It aims to provide a uniform interface for different datasets, a full set of models and evaluation metrics, as well as examples to reproduce (near) state-of-the-art results.

*Currently three trackers are implemented: [SiamFC](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~luca/siamese-fc.html), [GOTURN](http://davheld.github.io/GOTURN/GOTURN.html) and [MDNet](http://cvlab.postech.ac.kr/research/mdnet/).*

## Installation

Install [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) (version >= 0.4.0). Currently we only support python3.
